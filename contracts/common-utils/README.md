# Common Utilities

This crate provides shared validation, calculation, and helper functions used across all Zicket smart contracts. It was created to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistency in business logic validation and error handling.

## Modules

### `validation`

Common validation utilities for contract inputs and business rules:

- **Basis Points Validation**
  - `is_valid_basis_points(bps)` - Validates basis points are in range 0-10000
  - `validate_basis_points_sum(values)` - Sums values with overflow detection; returns `Some(total)` on success or `None` on overflow. Callers must verify the result equals `TOTAL_BASIS_POINTS` (10,000) for complete allocation validation.
  - Constants: `TOTAL_BASIS_POINTS = 10_000`, `MAX_REVENUE_SPLIT_RECIPIENTS = 5`

- **Revenue Split Validation**
  - `validate_revenue_splits(splits, organizer)` - Comprehensive validation of revenue splits
    - Empty splits allowed (single organizer mode)
    - Maximum 5 recipients
    - Basis points must sum to exactly 10000
    - No zero allocations
    - No duplicate recipients
    - Index 0 must be the primary organizer

- **Revenue Share Calculation**
  - `calculate_recipient_share(splits, recipient, organizer, net_amount)` - Calculates individual share
    - Uses floor division for non-primary recipients
    - Primary organizer (index 0) receives remainder (captures dust)
    - For empty splits, only the organizer receives the full amount; others receive 0
    - Ensures sum of shares equals net amount (no dust leakage)
  - `find_recipient_basis_points(splits, recipient)` - Finds allocation for a recipient
  - `is_split_recipient(splits, address)` - Checks if address is a recipient

### `revenue`

Revenue calculation and distribution utilities:

- **Fee Calculations**
  - `calculate_platform_fee(gross_amount, platform_fee_bps)` - Calculates platform fee
  - `calculate_net_amount(gross_amount, platform_fee_bps)` - Net after fee deduction

- **Share Distribution**
  - `calculate_all_shares(splits, organizer, net_amount)` - Calculates all recipient shares
    - For empty splits, returns single entry with organizer receiving full amount
  - `verify_shares_sum(shares, expected_total)` - Verifies no dust leakage

### `errors`

Standardized error codes and utilities for error handling:

- **CommonErrorCode** - Standard error categories across all contracts
  - Resource errors (1-10): NotFound, AlreadyExists
  - Authorization errors (11-20): Unauthorized
  - Validation errors (21-40): InvalidInput, InvalidAmount, InvalidStatusTransition, InvalidFeeBps
  - State errors (41-60): NotActive, NotCompleted, AlreadyProcessed
  - Configuration errors (61-80): NotInitialized, NotConfigured
  - Business logic errors (81-100): InsufficientFunds, MaxLimitReached, SoldOut
  - System errors (101-120): ContractPaused, TransferFailed, AccountingMismatch
  - Migration errors (121-130): MigrationFailed, UnsupportedVersion

- **error_message(code)** - Provides human-readable messages for standard error codes

## Usage

### Adding to Your Contract

1. Add dependency to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
common-utils = { path = "../common-utils" }
```

2. Import in your contract:

```rust
use common_utils::validation;
use common_utils::revenue;
```

### Example: Validating Revenue Splits

```rust
use common_utils::validation;

fn validate_splits(
    splits: &soroban_sdk::Vec<(Address, u32)>,
    organizer: &Address,
) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    validation::validate_revenue_splits(splits, organizer)
        .map_err(|_| ContractError::InvalidSplitConfig)
}
```

### Example: Calculating Revenue Shares

```rust
use common_utils::validation;

fn calculate_shares(
    splits: &soroban_sdk::Vec<(Address, u32)>,
    recipient: &Address,
    organizer: &Address,
    net_revenue: i128,
) -> i128 {
    validation::calculate_recipient_share(splits, recipient, organizer, net_revenue)
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Code Reuse** - Eliminates duplicate validation logic across contracts
2. **Consistency** - Ensures all contracts use the same validation rules
3. **Maintainability** - Single source of truth for common business logic
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage for shared utilities
5. **Documentation** - Clear documentation of validation rules and calculations

## Design Decisions

### Dust Handling

The revenue share calculation uses a specific strategy to handle integer division dust:

- Non-primary recipients receive `floor(net * bps / 10000)`
- Primary organizer (index 0) receives the remainder
- This ensures the sum of all shares always equals the net amount
- No revenue is ever stranded due to rounding

### Empty Split Safety

For empty splits (legacy single-organizer mode):

- `calculate_recipient_share()` requires an explicit organizer parameter
- Only the organizer receives the full amount; other addresses receive 0
- `calculate_all_shares()` returns a single entry with the organizer
- This prevents accidental miscalculation in edge cases

### Error Code Standardization

`EventError`, `PaymentError`, and `TicketError` share a unified discriminant
scheme built on `CommonErrorCode`:

- Variants that match a `CommonErrorCode` category use that category's
  canonical number (documented on the variant with a `// CommonErrorCode::*`
  comment). Where a contract has only one variant in a given category, that
  number carries the same meaning across contracts. Where a contract has
  more than one variant in the same category, only the first uses the
  canonical number -- further same-category variants fill the next free
  slot in that category's band. Those slots identify the shared category
  only (e.g. "this is a resource error"), not a specific universal error, so
  decoding a duplicate-slot discriminant still requires the originating
  contract or enum type to know which specific variant it is.
- Variants with no common-category equivalent live in a contract-specific
  extension range with no overlap across contracts: `EventError` 200-299,
  `PaymentError` 300-399, `TicketError` 400-499.

This provides:

- Consistent error patterns for SDK integration
- Human-readable error messages
- A raw discriminant that identifies its semantic category (and, for
  domain-specific errors, its originating contract) without needing the
  enum type

## Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
cargo test -p common-utils
```

The test suite includes:

- Basis points validation edge cases
- Revenue split validation (empty, valid, invalid configurations)
- Empty split safety (organizer-only, non-organizer, all-shares behavior)
- Share calculation with and without dust
- Platform fee calculations
- Share sum verification

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to this crate:

- Privacy validation utilities (currently scattered across contracts)
- Date/time validation helpers
- Token transfer wrappers with standard error handling
- Event emission utilities
